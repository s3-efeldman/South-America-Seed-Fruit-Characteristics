The South American Seed/Fruit Characteristics Dataset contains information on seed and fruit traits for 676 mammal-dispersed plant species from 96 families found in South America. 

This data was compiled for forthcoming publication. However, we have already begun to expand the dataset beyond the scope of this publication. It is important for us to make this data publicly available because of the current limited resources providing well reported data for a significant number of plant species characteristics. Details such as uncertainty and sample size are often left out of databases, but are important for understanding the credibility of reported values and variation within and among species. By giving the public access to our database, we hope to encourage better reporting on botanical data and act as a foundational point for others looking to explore this field.

# Traits Included
Wild/not wild: Wild plants are those that are native to South America. Not wild plants are those that are introduced, invasive, or cultivated in South America.  
Fruit type: Fleshy/dry and dehiscent/indehiscent  
Color: Color of the outside of the fruit  
Number of seeds/fruit  
Seed length, width, and mass  
Fruit length, width, and mass

# Methods
We obtained our information regarding seed and fruit characteristics from published literature and unpublished thesis in English, Spanish, and Portuguese. For each listed plant species, we used  the search phrase “‘species name’ AND fruit” on Google Scholar. We defined “length” as the distance along the longest axis of the fruit seed and "width" as the distance across the second longest axis. We only collected length and width data from articles that provided both measurements, explicitly stated how measurements were taken, or defined length/width. If the articles on the first five pages of Google Scholar did not provide us with necessary information, we referred to the databases found in The Encyclopedia of Life. If fruit or seed measurements were not found in the Google Scholar articles or EOL, we used herbarium specimens from the online collections of the Missouri Botanical Garden, Kew Royal Botanical Gardens, and The Field Museum. We used ImageJ (Schneider et al. 2012) to measure fruits and seeds in photos that provided scales. We used all the fruit and seeds present in the images in order to find appropriate average and standard deviation for both length and width. For any necessary information for our forthcoming publication (Wild/Not Wild, Color, Fruit Type, Number Seeds/Fruit, Seed Width, Fruit Width) still missing, we repeated the procedure for all species listed as synonyms according to Kew Royal Botanical Gardens. When there were discrepancies in reported data (numbers of seeds per fruit, seed width, or fruit width), we prioritized information from published sources and theses. 

# Forthcoming publication
Large mammals have a great impact on seed dispersal of many plants due to their ability to disperse large seeds over long distances. However, mammalian effects on other characteristics of plant species (such as color, fruit type, fruit size, etc)  are not well known. By studying these effects in greater detail, we can better understand the impact that the loss of large-bodied and threatened mammals can have on plant species. In this study we ask how the loss of (a) threatened or (b) large mammals affects the availability of dispersers for plants with varying native ranges, fruit color, fruit type, number of seeds per fruit, seed width, and fruit width. We conducted a systematic review using Google Scholar on 17 mammal species selected from a species lists of frugivorous mammals in the Orinoco Region, most of which have a range overlapping with the Andes and the Amazon region. We considered a mammal to disperse a given species of plant if the text explicitly stated that plant was dispersed by the mammal or if the study found intact seeds of the plant in the stomach or feces of the mammal. From there, we compiled a comprehensive dataset featuring the seed and fruit characteristics of over 600 various plant species from northern South America. These include color, fruit type,  native ranges,  fruit and seed measurements and other characteristics that can help us categorize  plant species for this project. We used a bipartite network to analyze the 7 plant traits and two additional networks to represent extinction scenarios involving threatened and large mammals. The impact of these extinctions on the number of links to mammals associated with each plant trait category was quantified through proportional change. 

We look forward to sharing our results, code, a supplement on averaging plant trait data, and the citation for this database in the upcoming months.
